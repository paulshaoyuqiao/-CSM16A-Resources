## Overview 
Hi there! Welcome to the EECS 16A Resources Website under Computer Science Mentors (CSM),
the largest student-run teaching organization on Berkeley campus for lower-division 
computer science and electrical engineering classes. We created this website for all
current students enrolled in an EECS 16A CSM section and for anyone who is interested in 
learning the materials in EECS 16A (Designing Information Systems and Devices - I) and aims 
to provide a much easier access to all the worksheets, slides, video walkthroughs, and review 
session materials provided during the current offering of the course. We hope you will find
this website helpful. For any course-related logistical questions (such as homework and exam
grading), please refer to the official EECS 16A course website for staff contact information:
