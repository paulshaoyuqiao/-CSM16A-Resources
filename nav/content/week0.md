## Summary
This week in class, we are introduced to primarily two topics:
1. Why EECS 16A and some of its applications in real life
2. Systems of Equations and Gaussian Elimination
3. An Application of Systems of Equations: Imaging

Some of the key takeaways from these topics include:
- A system of linear equations can be used to summarize a compositional linear 
relationships between the quantities we want to solve for and our measurements
- We can refactor and create a more compact and systematic representation of
linear equations using vectorization (**expressing systems in terms of 
vectors and matrices**)
- We can apply **Gaussian Elimination Algorithm** to solve a system of any
number of linear equations (equivalently, **row-reducing an augmented matrix**)
- We can determine the number of solutions a system of linear equations will have
(**unique**, **infinitely many**, **no solutions**) by observing the **reduced** form 
of the augmented matrix
