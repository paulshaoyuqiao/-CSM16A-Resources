# Content

This section contains a summary of the key concepts covered every week in lectures, along
with some of the key observations, advice, and common pitfalls that we have found helpful
for the students throughout our teaching. You are encouraged to reference the content as 
much as you need to, and feel free to ask your mentors for clarification or provide your
feedbacks if you want any particular part of the page improved.
