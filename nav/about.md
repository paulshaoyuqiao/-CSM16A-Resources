        I'm a junior from Shanghai who isn't an international student because I was born in Michigan but will still tell you I'm Chinese. I've been in CSM since my second semester and truly believe it will reshape EECS education at Cal. I especially believe in its power to change student perceptions of EE courses. When I'm not CSM-ing, you can find me in the a cappella group the California Golden Overtones, building mobile apps, or biking around the area.

        Hey! I'm a big fan of good times and fun vibes (and occasionally EE 16A). Come join! :') A little bit more about me: I'm a third year EECS major and I enjoy swimming, sunsets, and procrastinating more than I should. I apparently enjoy sad boi music, but also I don't listen to music much. I really enjoy Marvel movies and Game of Thrones, but I have yet to finish either of those (oop).      </div>

        Hello there! I'm a 3rd year EECS major from the Bay Area. I like programming languages where the compiler yells at you a lot. Outside CSM, I'm a Music Director and saxophonist for the Intermission Orchestra, and I spend an inordinate amount of my breaks watching anime. Also, I run this website. This means I get to put fancy formatted text in my bio (as long as I remember to edit it in)

            Hi, it’s Kat! I’m a second year EECS major from Arcadia, CA. In my spare time, love to travel, dance, and draw. My favorite food is strawberries and I don’t listen to music (yes, I know it’s weird). I’m excited to meet everyone and to dive into circuits and linear algebra together :)        </div>

            Rishi is a 4th year EECS & Applied Math student from Saratoga CA. When not playing card games, “singing” “songs”, making amazing puns, and saying “Good Morning” at all times of the day, Rishi enjoys studying for classes, coding for research, and attempting to teach students. Rishi would now like to thank the reader for reading his bio and he very much hopes to see them in discussion!

            Hi! I'm Zack! I am currently majoring in CS and researching security for machine learning. I enjoy watching basketball (huge Warriors fan), hiking, listening to music (some of my favorite artists are Cage the Elephant and Tierra Whack), and eating way too much. My favorite instant ramen is Indomie, in case you want to get some for me *cough* *cough*. I am also a member of the EE 16A course staff, so feel free to ask me any questions about course operations. Peace!

          Hello! I’m a fourth year Math and CS major from Arcadia, CA. When I’m not CSMing or studying for midterms, I’m usually watching Man U, playing video games (FE3H / XC2), or eating at Shooting Star Cafe. Feel free to talk to me about anything, or listen to me talk to you about how we’re actually living in a Hilbert Space.
